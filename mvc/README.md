# Zend Framework Tutorial Repository

These are sources for tutorials published at [Alex Tech Adventures](http://alex-tech-adventures.com) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXRC3l-ZhN3rQrtVm9nLe_vRi7AB-iWOX).
The tutorial is derived from original Zend Skeleton application. You can view full original install README file at [Original Repository](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication). 

Use branches to explore tutorial milestones.  You can checkout any branch to see how the application behaves.
I recommend detailed reading of commit diffs to understand how exactly some concept works, or how to perform a task within the framework.

If you have any fixes or improvements, you may submit a PR against `devel` branch.
